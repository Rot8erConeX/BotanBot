Energized\0\"Energy" is a special kind of buff which upgrades certain skills once five energy levels have been accumulated.

Skill Share\0\You may now equip up to 2 predetermined skills from other adventurers, but only the leader of a team may do so. The story units are free to share from, other units will require you to unlock sharing, via paying elemental tomes equivalent to the share cost of the skill in question. The first skill you share will replace your weapon skill, and the second will replace your helper. You may still take only one skill and use a helper. All damaging skills will have their potencies reduced by 30% (but Afflictions generated by shared skills do not suffer the halved damage penalty), and all heal skills will have their potencies halved. Elementally biased skills, such as strength buffs that only affect *wind-attuned* adventurers, will retain their bias. All other skills will change their elements to match the user. Skills all come with a cost, and the sum of any two skills that you choose to share cannot exceed 10. SP costs will **not** be the same when shared as they are for the base adventurer, unless you are named Yaten. If you share from a unit with their mana spiral unlocked, you will receive their level 4 skill as long as it has been unlocked, regardless of the lead adventurer's mana node status. Adventurers cannot equip skills from themselves, but may equip skills from variants. For example, story Ranzal cannot equip skills from story Ranzal, but he can equip skills from Gala Ranzal.\-
Skill Shift\0\Skill Shift is a system in which certain skills are upgraded when they connect with a foe.;; When Skill Shift has activated once, the skill is said to be in "Phase II".
